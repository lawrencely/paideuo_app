===============================================

<%= @partner.name %> you were carefully chosen to encourage and give paideuó.

Paideuó, Pronounced (pahee-dyoo'-o) means "a child under development with strict training" – properly, to train up a child, so they mature and realize their full potential (development). This requires necessary discipline (training), which includes administering chastisement (punishment).

So dish it out and get them back on track!
