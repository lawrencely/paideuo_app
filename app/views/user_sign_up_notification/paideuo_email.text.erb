<%= @partner.name.capitalize %> it's Paideuó Time.
===============================================

<%= @partner.name.capitalize %> you were carefully chosen to encourage and give paideuó.

Paideuó, Pronounced (pahee-dyoo'-o) means "a child under development with strict training" – properly, to train up a child, so they mature and realize their full potential (development). This requires necessary discipline (training), which includes administering chastisement (punishment).

If this is the first time they have failed to complete a task, we suggest you give them encouragement and support, but if this is becoming a consistent theme you know what to do.

So dish it out and get them back on track!

Under Paideuó
